   :sorted:

**BAM**
    Beam arrival monitor, monitors the time when the FEL beam arrives.

**BDA**
    Beam distribution area (behind the gas monitor detector).

**bunch charge**
    The total charge of an electron microbunch.

**CAMP chamber**
    CFEL ASG multipurpose chamber, with CFEL being the Center for Free-Electron Laser.

**DLD**
    Delay line detector, measures the (x,y) positions of electrons by two pairs of timing difference measurements.

**GMD**
    Gas monitor detector, measures the intensity of the FEL beam before and after the gas attenuator. It contains the parts before (**GMD_Tunnel**) and after (**GMD_BDA**) the FEL undulator tunnel. Technical details of the detector see `[Tiedke08]`.

**FEL**
    Free electron laser.

**HEXTOF analyzer**
    High energy X-ray time of flight analyzer. A measurement device that records simultaneously the (kx, ky, E) coordinates of the photoelectrons emitted within the X-ray photoemission horizon. It is later rebranded and sold by SPECS GmbH under the name METIS.

**SASE**
    Self-amplified spontaneous emission.

**ToF**
    Time of flight.

**macrobunch**
    A macroscopic bunch of electrons which can possess substructures (i.e. microbunches). It is the operating unit of a high-gain FEL and also referred to colloquially as a pulse train. Each macrobunch of electrons is tagged by the macrobunch ID.

**microbunch**
    A subunit of a high-gain FEL pulse train due to spatial redistribution and localization of electrons within a macrobunch -- a phenomenon called `micronbunching <http://photon-science.desy.de/facilities/flash/the_free_electron_laser/how_it_works/high_gain_fel/index_eng.html>`_. Each microbunch of electrons is tagged by a microbunch ID. A well-behaving FEL has a stable number of microbunches within a macrobunch, although the total microbunch number can vary between beam time slots due to change in the machine parameters.

**dd**
    `Dask dataframe <http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/dataframe.html>`_ -- a parallelized version of the `pandas dataframe <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html>`_.

**run number**
    Integer label of an experimental run. Every scan shares a single run number.

**file number**
    Integer label of a file in an experimental run.
